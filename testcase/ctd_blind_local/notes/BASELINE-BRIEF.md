# CTD phosphorylation by P-TEFb — in vitro time course (bench note)

## The system

RNA polymerase II carries a long, flexible tail on its largest subunit called the
C-terminal domain, or CTD. The CTD is not a folded domain: it is a tandem array of
short repeats, each seven amino acids long, with the sequence Tyr–Ser–Pro–Thr–Ser–Pro–Ser.
In human Pol II there are 52 of these heptarepeats. During transcription the CTD is
progressively decorated with phosphate groups, and the resulting pattern of marks is
what recruits and releases the RNA-processing and elongation factors that act on the
polymerase. Which marks are present, and where, is therefore functionally important.

The kinase we are studying here is **P-TEFb** (the CDK9–cyclin T1 complex), which acts
during transcriptional elongation.

## The experiment

This is an **in vitro kinase assay**, not a cellular experiment. There is no
transcription, no DNA, no polymerase — only a purified CTD substrate, purified kinase,
and ATP in buffer.

- **Substrate**: a recombinant CTD construct containing **8 heptarepeats**, not the full
  52. Present at **100 µM**.
- **Kinase**: P-TEFb, catalytic. It is not consumed and its concentration does not change
  over the experiment.
- **ATP**: **3 mM** at the start. Each phosphorylation consumes one ATP.
- **Sampling**: four time points — **0, 1 h, 2 h and 16 h** (0, 60, 120 and 960 minutes).
- **Replication**: one measurement per species per time point. There are **no replicate
  measurements** in this dataset.

## What the readout is, and what it cannot see

The readout is **mass spectrometry** on the intact CTD construct. MS separates the
substrate molecules by mass, and since each phosphate adds a fixed mass, it resolves
**how many of the eight repeats carry a phosphate** — a number between 0 and 8.

**It does not resolve which repeats those are.** A molecule phosphorylated on repeats 1
and 2 and a molecule phosphorylated on repeats 1 and 7 are the same mass and appear in
the same peak. Everything downstream has to live with that: the data are nine numbers per
time point, one for each phosphorylation count, and the positional arrangement behind
those numbers is not observed.

A second point about the chemistry, established previously for this kinase and these
conditions: within a single heptarepeat, phosphorylation happens on **either Ser2 or
Ser5, but not both at once**. So for the purposes of counting, each repeat is either
modified or unmodified — one bit per repeat — and the distinction between the two serine
positions does not need to be tracked.

## The data file, and a caveat you must handle

`data/ctd_ms_timecourse.csv` has one row per time point and nine columns, `phos0_rel`
through `phos8_rel`: the relative MS signal for CTD molecules carrying 0, 1, … 8
phosphates.

**These are relative signal intensities, not concentrations, and they are not comparable
between time points as they stand.** Mass spectrometry reports intensities on an
arbitrary scale that drifts between injections. You can see this directly in the file:
the nine numbers sum to 1.00 at t = 0, to 4.07 at 1 h, to 3.79 at 2 h and to 0.85 at
16 h, even though the total amount of substrate in the tube is conserved throughout.
Any model of this data needs a way to map predicted amounts onto measured intensities,
and that mapping is not the same at every time point.

The measurement error is believed to scale with the signal rather than being constant in
absolute terms.

## What is already believed, and what is not settled

Earlier work on this kinase, using this kind of hyperphosphorylation assay in human and
in *Drosophila*, concluded that P-TEFb works **distributively rather than processively**:
that it modifies a repeat, lets go, and rebinds — rather than holding on and running
along the substrate. That conclusion came from looking at the shape of MS distributions
by eye, and was never checked against a quantitative model.

Beyond that, the mechanism is genuinely open. We do not know from these data what governs
the rate at which any individual repeat gets modified, and that is what we would like a
model to tell us. One specific possibility was put to us and we want it tested rather than
assumed either way: that the modification of one repeat changes the rate at which its
immediate neighbours in the array are modified, as opposed to the rate depending only on
how many repeats of the molecule are already modified (cooperativity between repeats,
which was also raised as a possibility to look at), or on nothing at all.

## What can be computed here

Any model that simulates is acceptable, whether it tracks only how many repeats are
modified or which repeats are modified (with eight repeats, 256 configurations). Models
of a few hundred states and a thousand reactions simulate in seconds on the machine this
runs on, so size alone is not a reason to prefer one description over another; choose
the description the question needs.

## The question

Build a model of this time course that explains the measured distributions, and tell us
what it implies about how P-TEFb modifies the CTD. Be explicit about what these data can
and cannot establish — with eight repeats, four time points and no positional
information, we expect there to be things the data simply cannot decide, and we would
rather know which those are than have them glossed over.

## What we want back

The question, as we would put it to a modeller:

> Build a model of this CTD phosphorylation time course that explains the measured distributions, and say what it implies about how P-TEFb modifies the substrate. Report explicitly what these data can and cannot establish about the mechanism. In particular, test whether the modification of a repeat changes the rate at which its immediate neighbours in the array are modified, against the alternatives that the rate depends only on how many repeats are already modified (cooperativity between repeats) or on nothing at all, and say which of these the data can and cannot separate.

Deliverables:

- the mechanism of phosphorylation that best explains the measured distributions, identified and defended
- a statement of which mechanistic questions these data cannot answer
- the model itself, in a form we can run (Antimony or SBML with the parameter values, or a PEtab problem), and the fitted parameter values

What would make us accept the answer:

- the selected mechanism is reported with its information criterion, its Akaike weight and the indistinguishable set, honestly, whatever they turn out to be
- the observation model is stated explicitly, including how predicted amounts are mapped onto relative MS intensities at each time point
- any mechanistic question the data cannot resolve is named as unresolved rather than decided

Out of scope:

- transcription, DNA and the polymerase itself — this is a purified in vitro assay
- the distinction between Ser2 and Ser5 within a repeat (established as mutually exclusive under these conditions; each repeat is one bit)

The model must contain: the CTD substrate, resolved by number of phosphorylated repeats; the kinase P-TEFb; ATP.

## Ground rules for this exercise

- Work from this note and the data file only. Do not search for, cite or reuse a published model of this dataset; if you recognise the data, say so and continue as if you did not.
- Every assumption you make that this note does not settle goes into the written answer, with the reason.
- Keep a plain log of the session: each prompt or turn, what was run, the wall time and the cost, so the exercise can be compared with the same numbers from the workflow run.

Data: `ctd_ms_timecourse.csv`, one row per time point, columns `time_min` and `phos0_rel` to `phos8_rel`.
